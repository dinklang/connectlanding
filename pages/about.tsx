              At Connect Internal, we are passionate about connecting nurses with the best opportunities available within the healthcare industry. We understand the challenges nurses face when searching for internal contracts (which generally have the most favorable rates). That's why we have already done all the groundwork of looking for these contracts and simplify the process, making it easier than ever for nurses to access internal contracts.

                Our mission is to empower nurses and streamline their job search
                by providing a centralized hub where hospitals can post their
                internal contracts. We have done the groundwork of searching for
                and compiling these contracts, so nurses no longer need to spend
                hours searching various sources or rely solely on agencies. By
                eliminating these obstacles, we enable nurses to focus on what
                matters mostâ€”delivering exceptional care to patients.
